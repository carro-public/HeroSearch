# HeroSearch

Laravel Scout elasticsearch driver base on our own needs.

## What's hero-search

Before Carro, it was car hero. Base on that, we named our elastic-scout package as hero search.
Hero search is a scout package. We created this for our own needs. Currently, this was mostly inspred via [this course](https://codecourse.com/courses/create-a-laravel-scout-elasticsearch-driver). We will keep add the features base on our needs.
